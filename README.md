## ABSTRACT:
In this project, we will analyze and predict the win possibilities of deals/projects for an IT consulting company and see how the possibility of winning a deal is impacted by other variables. This will enable the IT consulting company to manage the effort required to win a deal to meet the growth targets.

## PROJECT OUTLOOK:
IT firms compete for winning large deals by designing and proposing solutions to their clients. Even a marginal improvement in the win rate can result
into substantial revenue addition for IT firm .
By predicting the probability of winning a deal, the management teams can prioritize the pipeline of opportunities to staff.

## OBJECTIVE:
➢ Predictive Analytics - Build a ML model to predict the probability of win/loss for bidding activities for a potential client.
➢ Prescriptive Analytics – Identify variable/s that are most likely to help in converting an opportunity into a win.
➢ Recommending top 5 Head-Bid Manager.
➢ For every false prediction calculate the loss which the company will face.

## Overview Of the problem
There is a single file which contains data related to the projects/deals won or lost. This data contains the project category, price and sector from
2011 to 2018.
# Objective 1: Predictive
Analytics - Build a ML model to predict the probability of win/loss for bidding activities for a potential client. 
# Objective 2: Prescriptive Analytics – Identify variable/s
that are most likely to help in converting an opportunity into a win.
