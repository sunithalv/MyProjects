## ABSTRACT:
In this project, we will analyze and predict the fraud detection wrt the online transactions. There are multiple classified datasets provided which have to be merged to get the final training dataset. A test dataset is provided seperately for prediction purpose.

## PROJECT OUTLOOK:
Fraud in online transactions is a big issue in the banking domain and this model strives to identify the fraudulent transactions based on the patterns visible in the datasets provided.

## OBJECTIVE:
➢ Predictive Analytics - Build a ML model to predict the fraudulent transactions
➢ Prescriptive Analytics – Identify variable/s that are most likely to contribute to identifying the fraudulent transaction

## CHALLENGES:
Imbalanced dataset and hence oversampling done to overcome it.

## MODEL BUILDING:
Random Forest Classifier with an accuracy of 90.5%
